reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-objective optimization problem

Here are some new algorithms for multi-objective optimization problem based on deep reinforcement learning.
I am hope to talk to anyone who also interests this problem.

now, I have tested Q-learning and simple Actor-critic algorithms on problem SCH,
just a start, go on...
